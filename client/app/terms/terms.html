			<h2>Transcript</h2>

			<p>Transcribe4me provides a streamlined, easy-to-use service and a quality low-cost transcript. Every word spoken on the audio file uploaded by the service user is typed. Speakers are identified as SP1, SP 2, SP 3 when there are 1-3 speakers and SP when there are 4 or more speakers.</p>


			<h2>Payment</h2>

			<p>Transcribe4me charges a single rate which is calculated per audio second with no extra charges. Payment must be made by the service user via the Transcribe4me website, using either a debit or credit card or a Stripe account, before commencement of any transcription.  The transcript is queued. Work begins on a transcript immediately upon receipt by Transcribe4me of payment.</p>


			<h2>Delivery</h2>

			<p>Transcribe4me aims to transcribe and deliver transcripts on or before the due date stated when the order is placed. A notification email will be sent to the service user when a transcript is available for collection. Should there be a delay in delivery, Transcribe4me will make every effort to notify the service user of such delay, but does not accept liability for any refund, loss or damages, whether direct or consequential, resulting from a delay in the delivery of any transcript.</p>

			 

			<h2>Review</h2>

			<p>The level of accuracy of a transcript can be affected when an audio file has poor quality sound and/ or speakers who cannot be heard clearly or whose accents are hard to comprehend. Transcribe4me strives to deliver the best possible product. However, the accuracy of a transcript will always be commensurate with the recording quality. In the event that a service user is not satisfied with the quality of a transcript, a review by Transcribe4me of the document can be requested, provided the request is received by Transcribe4me within 7 days of transcript completion.</p>


			<h2>Re-do</h2>

			<p>The service user will be notified of the result of a review as speedily as possible and, where necessary, the transcript will be redone at no extra cost.</p>


			<h2>Refund</h2>

			<p>In the event that a redone transcript is not to the service user’s satisfaction, a second review may be requested and the service user will be notified of the result as soon as possible. Should Transcribe4me deem it justified, a refund will be made to the service user within 30 days of such notification and paid back into the Debit Card or Credit Card account from which payment was made. No interest on any such amount or reimbursement of administrative or other charges which may have been incurred by the service user will be paid. However, Transcribe4me reserves the right to deduct a 5% administration fee from any refund made.</p>


			<h2>Confidentiality, privacy and security</h2>

			<p>Transcribe4me will treat the service user’s information as strictly confidential and will not disclose it, either in whole or in part to any third party. Proprietary Information means all content, data and information collected in interviews, meetings or otherwise and contained in audio files which the service user uploads.</p>
